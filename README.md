# data-analysis-app
this is a repo that contains all the code used to complete the task given in the PCP assessment 1. it was completed using python programming

the text below is the task given

You are to design and implement a robust data loading module containing at least a function for loading the data from the provided dataset. The dataset should be retrieved into a nested dictionary, which should be returned by the function. 
b.	Query Module
In this task, you will implement a module called the query module that contains several functions for querying the loaded dataset for various information.
i.	The work class feature has some missing values. Design and implement a function to retrieve any record with missing work class value.
ii.	A function that computes the standard deviation of capital gains and losses of any individual.
iii.	A function that retrieves the native country of any individual in the dataset.
iv.	A function that returns the total number of people from any given native country.
v.	A function that returns the total number of people with doctorate degrees.
vi.	A function that returns the occupation of any individual.
vii.	A function that returns basic statistics of people's marital status.
viii.	A function that returns the average age of people whose incomes are higher than 50k.
ix.	A function that returns the occupation of anyone whose income is less than 50k.
x.	A function that returns the percentage of people per gender whose income is higher than 50%. This function should also return the percentage of people per gender whose income is less than 50k.
xi.	A function that returns average, mode, mean, median income of each marital status.
xii.	A function that returns age, race, and gender of people whose incomes are higher than 50k.
xiii.	A function that returns age, race gender of people whose income is lower than 50k.
xiv.	A function that returns the income, gender, and race of anyone with a doctorate degree.
xv.	A function that persists the answers to all queries in a text file with .csv extension. The contents of the file should not be overwritten by any subsequent write operations. Please, do not use any other libraries other the file object you have been taught. DO NOT use CSV, Pandas Numpy or any other library apart from basic Python file handling object.

c.	User Interface Module
The last module, the user interface module contains a function that implements an interactive and menu-driven user interface functionality. The module will provide the functionality for querying the systems for any of the information in (b) above and for displaying answers. The queries and the displayed results should be user friendly.  The module should also allow users to continue with the system as long as they want or quit when they are done. In the user interface module, you need to import the query module to allow each function in (b) to be invoked.
d.	Optional implementation/Extension
You may choose to implement instead of a text-based menu-driven user interface in (c) above, a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Any other extension (such as using database management system to persist information instead of writing the information to a text file) is allowed but please discuss with your tutor to confirm what could be accepted as an extension. This will attract an additional 5% of the total marks.
